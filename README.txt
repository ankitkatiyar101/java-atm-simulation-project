ASSUMPTIONS:

 * Security manager policy files are assigned under BankServer, ATMServer and 
   Client's main methods respectively, so there's no need to specify them on 
   execution time.
 * Additional assumptions made during the programming assignment were Javadoc-
   documented in their respective Java source files.

HOW TO EXECUTE MAIN PROCESSES:

Be sure to compile all sources, then execute each of the following processes on
a different command prompt.
# java -classpath cscie55.project.BankServer
# java -classpath cscie55.project.ATMServer
# java -classpath cscie55.project.Client
